## Data

This dataset tracks daily values of the S&P 500 index, VIX (Volatility Index), and SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) from January 2, 2019 (S&P 500: 2510.03) to May 6, 2025 (S&P 500: 5606.91). Over this period, the S&P 500 more than doubled, reflecting significant long-term market growth despite periods of volatility. The VIX captures shifts in market sentiment, while SOFR, a key benchmark for short-term interest rates, remained relatively low and stable in recent data points.
