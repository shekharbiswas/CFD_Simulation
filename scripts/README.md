# CFD - Simulation Steps and Strategies

## Overview

This project simulates and compares different investment portfolio strategies using Contracts for Difference (CFDs).  
It is structured logically around clear hypotheses and financial metrics, offering insights into how CFDs can enhance or impact portfolio performance and risk.

The simulations are built on a solid framework (TCCM: Theory, Context, Characteristics, Methods) and focus on both static comparisons and dynamic strategies.
